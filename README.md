Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
========================================

This repo is for Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data.

run_analysis.R is the R code that performs the required actions in the project.

tidy_dataset.txt is the tidy dataset.

codebook.md is the code book required.

========================================

Iâ€™ve followed the steps given in the project requirement in the R code.

You should put the code along with the files such as features.txt, activity_labels.txt, etc.

That is, you should place the code in the main directory of the dataset.

There are comments in the code so that I will not repeat them here. Please read the code comments directly.
